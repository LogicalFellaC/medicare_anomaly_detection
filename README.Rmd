### Goal

Use Medicare billings data (over 9 million data points) to build an anomaly
detection algorithm using unsupervised learning methods.

### Algorithm

Local density-based outlier scores
  - LOF, LDF, RKOF, LPDF

### Advantages

- Automated generation of outlier metrics that do not depend on arbitrary criteria.
- Easily scalable.

### Possible usage

- Outlier detection on the current records.
- Building a classifier for future stream of billing records.
